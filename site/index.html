			Cake is a form of sweet food made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients, that is usually baked. In their oldest forms, cakes were modifications of bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can simple or elaborate, and that share features with other desserts such as pastries, meringues.
